0," April 18, 2019", [I] found it much more entertaining than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones.,C
1," January 26, 2019"," This tells the story of the downfall of the Jedi and the rise of Darth Vader well, and that's all I ever wanted out of the Prequels in the first place...",4/5
2," January 8, 2019"," The technical wizardry, the special effects, the ear-buzzing sound, the mind-numbing action and those magnificent light-sabres are all there.",3/4
3," December 17, 2018"," It missed at points and hit home runs in others, but it was a great end to a fun ride.",7.5/10
4," January 29, 2018"," Lucas controls himself, unlike in the previous prequels, and sticks to the most poignant issues, which makes the transition from Sith to A New Hope effortless.",B
5," November 13, 2017"," Lucas is not a master of writing dialogue... but save for some exaggerated or somewhat absurd moments, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a great ""Star Wars"" movie, a roller coaster of action and emotion. [Full review in Spanish]",3.5/4
6," June 5, 2016"," Some of it is is truly, unmissably great. Some of it is hilariously awful, and some of it is awful enough to not even crawl up to the level of hilarity",6/10
7," December 15, 2015"," The special effects, of course, are incomparably good and the digital photography achieves a dazzling clarity.",4/5
8," December 14, 2015"," With a willingness to take the Star Wars saga to its necessary darkest direction, 'Sith' delivers an epic, masterful payoff to the prequels. ",10/10
9," November 16, 2015", The best of Lucas's recent SW trilogy.,3/5
10," November 16, 2015"," Critics and fans are already praising the movie, claiming it's better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. But that's not difficult, as both movies were bad, and the new one is just as bad in many ways.",
11," November 16, 2015", Star Wars is awesome again.,4/5
12," November 16, 2015"," It soon becomes obvious that there is no avoiding the burden of predictability: there is nothing, essentially, in the film's story that we don't know already.",2.5/5
13," November 16, 2015"," From the opening frames of Lucas' final Star Wars instalment, it's clear the shackles are off.",4/5
14," November 16, 2015", Part III is much better than I and II. We should be grateful for that.,
15," November 16, 2015"," Lucas saved the best of his arguably needless prequels for last, finally justifying an entertainment empire and cementing a myth.",A-
16," November 16, 2015"," Devout fans will have to go. For the rest of us, the best rewards of this show were long ago, in a galaxy that now seems far, far away.",2/4
17," November 16, 2015", Sith comes back with full force.,4/5
18," November 16, 2015"," It might not be quite the mind-blowing finale that die-hard fans were hoping for, but at least there is enough here to make the spine tingle.",3/5
19," November 16, 2015"," Despite our knowing where the story goes, Sith keeps your attention through its 140-plus minutes. And that says something about Lucas's skill and the power of the universe he created.",
20," November 16, 2015"," Say what you want about Lucas' one-take directing style, his over-reliance on blue screens or his cheesy tendency to reference himself, but his imagination is as fertile as ever.",
21," November 16, 2015"," Special effects have greatly advanced since 1978, but technology needs imagination after it has made an initial impression. Imagination is not the strong suit of Revenge of the Sith.",
22," November 16, 2015"," The final, bridging movie between George Lucas's two epic Star Wars trilogies ends not with a bang but with plenty of artistic whimpering.",2/5
23," November 16, 2015"," Revenge of the Sith is, so Lucas assures us, a 'tragedy'. It might have been wise to have stationed an announcer at every movie house to announce this fact over the PA system since it eluded the audience I saw it with last weekend.",
24," November 16, 2015", Revenge of the Sith is far from a great film but it easily trumps its two predecessors.,
25," November 16, 2015"," The pity is that Lucas and his team couldn't have just manufactured the toys and the ""Making Of"" coffee table books and given the films a miss.",
26," November 16, 2015"," Strong, unrelenting, moving and bracingly exciting, Revenge Of The Sith is a fitting end to a truly great series.",
27," November 16, 2015"," For all the hype, I fear this is a film that only the most uncritical Star Wars fans will truly enjoy.",
28," November 16, 2015", I must say that I did get quite emotional in this.,3.5/5
29," November 16, 2015", I think it is visually exciting. I think there are wonderful things in it but I just missed that innocence of the early films.,3.5/5
30," November 13, 2015", [A] dramatically cogent and highly satisfying finale to the Star Wars saga.,
31," November 13, 2015"," Thankfully, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith has a good deal to offer besides its cachet as the farewell to a pop culture.",
32," November 13, 2015"," Episode III mainly is what it is -- the climax of a sometimes grand adventure that's more than the sum of its parts, yet much less than it might have been.",
33," September 3, 2010", The bar has been set so low in mainstream Hollywood movies that it's not even worth seriously analyzing this stuff,2.5/4
34," April 29, 2009"," As the finale approached, I just didn't want to leave my seat, because that meant it's all over... supposedly.",
35," October 18, 2008"," Lucas slips up on a few fronts en route, but doesn't disappoint when it counts.",
36," August 20, 2008"," Of course, being best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back isn't saying much, when you consider what came between...",
37," August 13, 2008"," A grave and vigorous popular entertainment, a picture that regains and sustains the filmic Force [Lucas] dreamed up a long time ago, in a movie industry that seems far, far away.",
38," July 14, 2007"," This one had the most potential, and in that way it is the most disappointing.",2.5/4
39," June 20, 2007", A fitting capstone on a collection of screen classics for the ages!,3/4
40," October 30, 2006", The only one of the trilogy that actually works as both a good Summer movie and a solid sci-fi movie in its own right.,2.5/4
41," October 24, 2006"," It's a profound movie, and a fine one. I've not even mentioned the visual aspect, which is miles above similar effects pictures, but we would expect that, not the excellence of filmmaking that contains it.",
42," October 3, 2006", full review in Greek,3.5/5
43," September 28, 2006"," The best-looking Star Wars episode of all, if not the most exciting, most imaginative or most affecting.",
44," August 22, 2006", Rich in cityscapes and costumes.,
45," May 12, 2006"," Lucas is a brilliant technician but a poor philosopher, and his lurchingly thought-out rendering of futuristic politics prevents the entire series from achieving the greatness to which it aspires.",
46," December 31, 2005"," .. even though Revenge is a better experience than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, it doesn't add anything that satisfying or compelling to the big picture.",
47," December 15, 2005"," The final third of this dark, brooding epic is utterly mesmerizing, building magnificently to a coda setting up all the events in the original trilogy with an as-to-now (at least in the prequels) unforeseen brilliance",3.5/4
48," December 6, 2005"," For me, Sith succeeds in providing a satisfying ending to the films while also closing a chapter of my own life.",4/5
49," December 6, 2005", It did what I thought was impossible after the previous two films: it made me a Star Wars fan again.,4/5
50," November 4, 2005"," A great Star Wars film and, dare I say, a great film onto itself.",4/4
51," October 7, 2005", a visually delicious film filled with ostensibly crowd pleasing (read boring) lightsaber battles...,C
52," September 26, 2005"," McGregor, Portman, and Christensen have all been brilliant elsewhere but the bonds between their characters are all in the dialogue, never between the lines. (And the less said about the lines themselves, the better.)",
53," July 21, 2005"," As blockbusters go, Revenge of the Sith has some good throwaway entertainment, but there have been better blockbusters with better throwaway entertainment.",2/5
54," July 21, 2005", The best thing about Episode III? Jar Jar Binks is barely in it. ,2.5/4
55," July 7, 2005"," Although the stiff theatrics are part of the design, they're no longer excusable.",2/4
56," July 5, 2005"," What makes this movie work is watching Anakin Skywalker break our hearts, and ultimately serve as a textbook example of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions.",4/5
57," July 5, 2005", In years to come George Lucas's farewell to his STAR WARS series may be considered his finest entry.,9/10
58," June 30, 2005"," Against all odds, the movie becomes more than the sum of its creaky parts, building enough emotional firepower to destroy an entire hard-bitten cynic such as myself.",3/4
59," June 28, 2005", This is the film we yearned for as we sat passively through the shoddy merchandise-oriented Phantom Menace and the dull romantic scenes of Attack of the Clones.,4/5
60," June 25, 2005"," For the 6th time in a row, George Lucas has done it again.",4.5/5
61," June 21, 2005", Why are blinds wipes and Fisher-Price spaceship interiors employed in a 2005 film?,3/5
62," June 18, 2005"," The film works fine as stand-alone entertainment, but does irreparable harm to the series as a whole.",B
63," June 17, 2005", A worthy end.,
64," June 11, 2005", Star Wars was a gamble in 1977. In 2005 Revenge of the Sith is the Empire.,3/5
65," June 7, 2005", Master Lucas Strikes Back!,A-
66," June 7, 2005"," Prepare to be blown away because George Lucasâ€™'s latest space opera is an absolute belter, recalling the old magic of The Empire Strikes Back and banishing forever painful memories of the last two Star Wars prequels.",4/5
67," June 6, 2005", George Lucas better not write a romance novel next because even Fabio couldn't save it. ,
68," June 5, 2005", Episode III hooks up to its sequel of 1977 as neatly as a space station landing dock.,4/5
69," June 4, 2005"," Veering from moments of breathtakingly visualized valor to outright stupidity, Sith is a vast improvement over the previous two outings, but still and all, it's no Star Wars.",3/5
70," June 4, 2005", I am pleased to report that George Lucas has found his way back from the Dark Side.,4/5
71," June 3, 2005"," As popcorn entertainment, strapping in for Star Wars: Episode III is like hooking up with an old friend. Half the enjoyment is simply the idea of the reunion itself.",3/4
72," June 3, 2005", ...it has become impossible to consider these movies apart from their dubious cultural and economic consequences.,C+
73," June 2, 2005"," As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer.",3/4
74," June 2, 2005", ...at once a work of closure and of sustenance.,3.5/4
75," June 1, 2005"," To Star Wars fans everywhere, a celebration of galactic proportions.",4/5
76," May 31, 2005"," Very good story telling, despite lapses into droll dialogue that takes itself too seriously.",B+
77," May 26, 2005"," Not far into the first third of the movie, I didn't think I was going to make it all the way through the percussive nonstop action.",
78," May 26, 2005"," It's a stronger movie than the two previous installments but, as Yoda would say: an out-and-out triumph it is not.",
79," May 25, 2005", ...the brilliant final showdown between Obi-Wan and Anakin for his soul is the moment that takes the Star Wars saga where it needs to go ...,3/4
80," May 25, 2005", So boxed in by having to tie everything into a neat parcel that it feels constrained and is woefully lacking in surprises and dramatic tension.,3.5/5
81," May 25, 2005", Spectacular ... but it never really lifts you up into a new imaginative realm -- it never takes you away. It just keeps blazing at you. ,3/5
82," May 24, 2005"," By golly, he did it!",B+
83," May 24, 2005", Overlooked amid the tired complaints of wooden acting and cornball dialogue is the most inspired filmmaking of Lucas's career.,Full ReviewRead More 
84," May 23, 2005", This film is very heavy on action and that is its saving grace.,B
85," May 23, 2005", (G)ood is seduced by evil and good must ulimately triumph is balance is to be restored and peace secured. Sound familiar? ,B+
86," May 23, 2005", Final installment still far cry from 70s pics.,
87," May 23, 2005"," In spite of the acting horrors who are Christensen and Portman, the ""Star Wars"" series manages to go out on a high note.",7/10
88," May 23, 2005"," Watching it, you realize that Lucas has created his own coup. He has stolen this trilogy back from the brink of disappointment and ended it with an intergalactic bang.",B+
89," May 23, 2005", The final hour ... delivers like Domino's pizza.,2.5/4
90," May 23, 2005", A fitting conclusion to a landmark franchise.,
91," May 22, 2005", What this film really accomplishes is it gives us insight into these characters that lessens their effectiveness in the later episodes.,1/5
92," May 22, 2005", Nominally better than its immediate predecessors thanks to a pervasive atmosphere of catastrophic doom.,C
93," May 22, 2005", ...an enticingly dark and absorbing spectacle that should satisfy the casual Star Wars fanatic who fancies an action-packed package full of emotional promise and prose.,3/4
94," May 22, 2005"," As every fan is well aware, Natalie Portman is destined to reveal her twins, and not the twins we were all hoping to see, if you know what I mean.",A-
95," May 22, 2005"," ...clearly the best of the prequel trio, and for me almost as good as Return of the Jedi. But this is largely because there are no Ewoks involved.",7/10

97," May 22, 2005", Easily the best of the prequels...,3/4
98," May 22, 2005"," All in all, this reviewer was satisfied with Star Wars III.",3/5
99," May 22, 2005"," a unique film in the way its primary objective is to certify what we already know, and the pleasure it generates is not in the surprise of what happens, but in how it happens",3.5/4
100," May 22, 2005"," Lucas has woven into the action and effects a relatively thoughtful story about a young man meant for greatness but corrupted by his own fear and confusion, a story more Shakespearean than Arthurian.",3/4
101," May 21, 2005"," Hardly the masterpiece that anxious fanboys have rushed to call it, Sith recovers much of the joy and the gravity that many feared had gone the way of the Ewoks.",3/4

103," May 21, 2005"," We always knew it would end like this, but sheesh!",3.5/5
104," May 21, 2005", One leaves the theater with a 30-year sense of closure and satisfaction,3/4
105," May 21, 2005"," Maybe Revenge of the Sith is the best film in the series because it's the last, and the adventure of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away returns, inevitably, to the here and now.",3/4
106," May 20, 2005"," This is downright brilliant filmmaking, an awesome spectacle that manages to balance thrills and emotion with a steady hand.",5/5

108," May 20, 2005"," A VinganÃ§a dos Sith engrandece toda a saga concebida por George Lucas. Esta Ã©, com o perdÃ£o do trocadilho, sua verdadeira ForÃ§a.",5/5

110," May 20, 2005", The prequel trilogy finally becomes what we have all wanted it to be.,3.5/4
111," May 20, 2005"," The action is pretty spectacular, especially the climactic light-saber duel and an all-too-brief sequence in which Yoda leads a Wookiee army into battle. Die-hard fans will be drooling all over that one.",3/4
112," May 20, 2005"," Oh, the relief to reach the conclusion of Star Wars Episode III, not because George Lucas has brought home the franchise safe and sound but because I know I will never have to sit through another minute of this turgid, subliterate spaceballs again.",1/5

114," May 20, 2005", Anakin switches teams and the force avoids becoming farce in Lucas' swan-song.,
115," May 20, 2005"," Growing up Star Wars is like growing up Catholic- no matter how bitter you might become, ya can't shake it. Last week I bought CHEEZ-ITs because R2-D2 was on the box.",

117," May 20, 2005"," No magic, little light, but an awful lot of heavy industry.",1/5
118," May 20, 2005"," Everything that has a beginning has a middle - and while this centerpiece to the Star Wars saga may indeed be middling, it still beats Return of the Jedi anyday.",
119," May 19, 2005", Redeems some of the luster lost from the previous two installments.,B+
120," May 19, 2005"," A glorious, perversely satisfying conclusion to a labor of love ... and a grand entertainment in its own right.",4/4
121," May 19, 2005"," There's some sadness knowing that the Star Wars pictures are done. However, I get intense pleasure knowing that the series concludes on the highest of high notes.",4/4

128," May 19, 2005", It turns out I'm still afraid of the Dark Side.,4/4
129," May 19, 2005"," There's precious little of the wonder and charm of the original Stars Wars films in this big, loud, and mostly empty spectacle.",2/4
130," May 19, 2005"," When the aim is pure visual spectacle, the results are brilliantly exciting. When the aim is heart-touching drama, though, the movie falls apart.",B
131," May 19, 2005", It's revenge of the Star Wars fan.,B+
132," May 19, 2005", Flat performances and even flatter dialogue give the final Star Wars prequel a hollow ring. ,
133," May 19, 2005"," The lurid attraction of Revenge of the Sith stems from its utter predictability, from our knowledge that this is the payoff for which five earlier films over 28 years were but one elaborate Greek chorus.",
134," May 19, 2005", Be still our little saber-loving hearts! It's here...,4/4
135," May 19, 2005"," It's the only new prequel that doesn't feel like robots were behind the camera, and the most thrilling, enthralling and tragic episode since Empire. ",3.5/4

140," May 19, 2005"," For once, the words 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' seem ironic, and it's hard to watch what follows without drawing comparisons to our own political landscape.",'3.5/4'
141," May 19, 2005"," Limbs are lost, people die, destruction is widespread, and evil reigns... all this violence is courtesy a mere PG-13 rating (thanks, MPAA!)",3.5/4.0
142," May 19, 2005", Got Wood? Christensen's stiff acting almost sink this digital ship. The last hour is absolutely brilliant.,A-
143," May 19, 2005"," This one is definitely the best of the three. Fear not, fans. Lucas came through in the clutch.",8/10
144," May 19, 2005"," It's meatier and more daring than [the first two prequels], and earns its place alongside the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.",3.5/4
145," May 19, 2005"," Lucas' attempted apolitical veneer only underlines the point: wars are political, even in movies.",

149," May 19, 2005"," An ideal, convincing finale for this franchise.",3/4
150," May 19, 2005"," Lucas' vision has matured, along with his digital special-effects tools. Lucky for us that the Force was often with him on this one.",3/4

152," May 19, 2005", ...falls down in the one area that it can't afford to - making us feel something at the moment Anakin goes to the Dark Side.,
153," May 19, 2005", The circle is now complete.,4.5/5
154," May 18, 2005"," Almost exactly what it needs to be, a powerful middle film to end one trilogy and presage another.",B+
155," May 18, 2005"," A slam-bang summer blockbuster. Completes, deepens, and enriches the series beyond the pop-cultural phenomenon it has long-since made for itself.",3/4
156," May 18, 2005"," Acquits the recent stinkiness of the series pretty well. I know, high praise indeed. But consider this - I knew what was going to happen, and I still cared.",4/5
157," May 18, 2005", Should satisfy all the fans and breed new ones. The Force is strong in this one.,3.5/4
158," May 18, 2005"," Beautifully choreographed, loud, furious and rib-shaking donnybrooks that are weaved of the long-gestating daydreams of fans.",4/4
159," May 18, 2005"," Remarkably, Lucas solicits even worse performances than in pictures past; the Mace Windu-Palpatine confrontation ranks amongst the worst acted scenes I've ever seen.",
160," May 18, 2005", The only disappointment - Natalie Portman does not wear the Princess Leia gold bikini.,5/4

162," May 18, 2005", Not only a perfect bridge to the original trilogy but will draw favorable comparisons to the fabled excellence of The Empire Strikes Back.,4/4
163," May 18, 2005"," George Lucas is much more interested in the reflection of some planet's third moon on a window than in the other reasons people go to movies, like acting and script.",B
164," May 18, 2005"," The film is pretty much wall-to-wall action, with little of the filibusters about trade unions that made Phantom Menace and Clones so irritating.",3/4
165," May 18, 2005"," Nostalgie et gravitÃ© aidant, La Revanche des Sith offre certainement quelques sÃ©quences d'anthologie et mÃªme certains moments d'Ã©motion palpable.",3.5/5

168," May 18, 2005"," Like the other two so-called 'prequels', this one still doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie . . .",
169," May 18, 2005"," At its best, Revenge of the Sith reaches that plateau where pop is art.",4/4
170," May 18, 2005"," A film that never wields the dramatic impact its plot should demand, and never realises the emotional potential at its dark heart.",3/5

172," May 18, 2005"," Episode III suffers from some of the same shortcomings... that its two recent predecessors did, only this time... far less...",3/4
173," May 18, 2005"," While Lord Lucas has failed to solve the problems that he has demonstrated throughout the sextet, he also has commandingly summited the zenith of what he is good at.",3.5/5
174," May 18, 2005", Revenge of the Sith might be tolerable if it weren't designed to be taken seriously.,
175," May 18, 2005"," Otherwise known as I Was a Teenage Darth Vader, Star Wars III is dull, puerile and underwritten, not that it will matter to its lemming-like legion of fans.",

218," May 17, 2005", We are all preprogrammed in one way or another to want Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith to climax in the way it does. All George had to do was not screw that up. He didn't.,

220," May 17, 2005"," For many, the Sith finale will redeem all three prequels. Others will wonder why Lucas wasted so many dollars, years and pixels on a story that could have been told in one film, or better yet, not at all.",2.5/4
