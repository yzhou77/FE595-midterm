1,1,1," February 8, 2019"," Captain America: The First Avenger is an agreeable diversion. It's rock 'em, sock 'em comic book fun, but unlike many of the onscreen locations, the story never really catches fire.",7.0

30,30,30," July 14, 2015"," Big and blousy, brash and loud and with a distinct twinkle in its star-spangled eye, it's the action movie to see if you really can't stomach any more wand-waving wizards and transforming robots.",9.0

37,37,37," June 22, 2013"," It's difficult to dislike ""Captain America"" too much, because it's harmless and innocuous and, unlike almost every other tentpole summer movie, isn't secretly trying to give the audience a seizure. ",5.0

66,66,66," August 3, 2011"," Rooted in reality and without the superhero tights, an impressive 3D success. The CGI transformation of Steve Rogers is fantastic. I worry that Stan Lee, through his Hickcock cameos, will appear in perpetuity in all Marvel movies.",7.0
67,67,67," August 2, 2011"," After a decade of Dark Knights and doom and gloom predominating the spandex set, it's a relief to see a noble, essentially uncomplicated funny book character, even if the good captain is square as a brick. ",8.0
