1,1,1," January 25, 2018"," Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re-watchable.",7.0
2,2,2," December 8, 2014", Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.,8.0
3,3,3," December 8, 2014"," For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.",6.0

5,5,5," December 8, 2014"," Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger.",3.0
6,6,6," December 8, 2014"," The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.",7.0
7,7,7," December 8, 2014"," Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.",10.0

9,9,9," December 8, 2014"," In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too.",7.0

11,11,11," December 8, 2014"," By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.",9.0
12,12,12," December 8, 2014"," All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.",10.0
13,13,13," December 8, 2014"," Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.",7.0
14,14,14," December 8, 2014"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today.",8.0

19,19,19," November 22, 2013"," Goblet again serves up a delicious who's who of British acting, with hilarious contributions from newcomers Brendan Gleeson as instructor Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter.",9.0
20,20,20," November 22, 2013"," Goblet of Fire is more effective in these smaller, more intimate moments than in the bloated bombast of its larger set pieces.",7.0

46,46,46," February 7, 2006"," In the book this is a wholly engrossing story -- an epic tale of good and evil and loss and yearning. Transported to the screen, however, it has sustained a few dinks and dents. ",6.0
47,47,47," January 17, 2006"," It's too episodic, relying on action rather than emotion. The pace is headlong, so that the characterisation suffers.",7.0

68,68,68," December 6, 2005"," Once again Grint, who has grown up to be a talented comic actor, is the scene stealer here. If I had a crystal ball, I'd say he's the actor whose post-Potter future seems most certain.",9.0

77,77,77," December 1, 2005"," The exhilarating Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes the best parts of J.K. Rowling's fourth installment and serves them up in one heck of an action-packed, albeit darker, film. Parents, be forewarned--this isn't kid's stuff anymore. ",10.0

81,81,81," November 27, 2005"," The best part, I think, is that this fourth Harry Potter film goes further than its predecessors in setting out a moral map that reaffirms the values of human decency, loyalty and selflessness - and does so with great flair and endless entertainment.",8.0
