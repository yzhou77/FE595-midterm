0," January 25, 2018"," Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re-watchable.",
1," December 8, 2014", Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.,4/5
2," December 8, 2014"," For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.",3/5
3," December 8, 2014"," For the first time, adults might actually enjoy a Harry Potter film as much as children.",
4," December 8, 2014"," Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger.",1.5/5
5," December 8, 2014"," The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.",3.5/5
6," December 8, 2014"," Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.",4/4
7," December 8, 2014"," I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason: it's not like a Harry Potter film.",
8," December 8, 2014"," In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too.",
9," December 8, 2014", The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.,3.5/4
10," December 8, 2014"," By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.",3.5/4
11," December 8, 2014"," All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.",5/5
12," December 8, 2014"," Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.",
13," December 8, 2014"," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today.",B+
14," December 8, 2014"," This fourth segment of now-adolescent Harry Potter's story, while arguably the best made, is also the most gruesome, and dark.",
15," December 8, 2014"," With its grand special effects, many small moments of charm, and continuing development of the characters, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes us into a world that, evil or not, makes us reluctant to leave.",4/5
16," November 22, 2013", Newell vividly conjures up a world fraught with real danger.,3/5
17," November 22, 2013"," As young wizard Harry Potter continues to mature, so too does this exciting fantasy franchise.",4/5
18," November 22, 2013"," Goblet again serves up a delicious who's who of British acting, with hilarious contributions from newcomers Brendan Gleeson as instructor Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter.",3.5/4
19," November 22, 2013"," Goblet of Fire is more effective in these smaller, more intimate moments than in the bloated bombast of its larger set pieces.",
20," June 15, 2013"," Very boring, recycled from the previous installments, and immensely underwhelming.",
21," January 13, 2013", Wait a minute. Sequels aren't supposed to get better.,3.5/4
22," July 16, 2011", It's downright scary how good this movie is.,
23," June 27, 2011"," A huge cast, plenty of special effects and Harry gets a battering -- pretty much as you'd expect.",3.5/5
24," June 27, 2011"," A marked disappointment after Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this fourth installment in the franchise is a 157-minute holding pattern.",
25," April 26, 2011", The Goblet of Fire is a more mature story and its young stars prove they have the acting skills to grow with their characters.,3.5/5
26," March 22, 2011", Easily the best Harry Potter film so far.,8/10
27," November 6, 2010"," The story is engrossing, but Mike Newell's adaption is a little too dull and by-the-numbers following Alfonso Cuaron's visual tour-de-force.",7/10
28," September 1, 2009"," Chapter four in the boy-wizard franchise, and still no good scenes, interesting characters, or true imagination",
29," April 3, 2009"," Followers of the series will find a more mature Harry and a more mature style, less sugary but not actually drier than the previous films.",+2 out of -4..+4
30," October 18, 2008", Goblet has enough sense of real kids maturing and believably facing problems to cast some genuine spells.,3.5/4
31," July 23, 2008", A solid but mostly uninspired melding of the adventure and fright that have been the benchmarks of the franchise.,3/4
32," January 15, 2008"," Like a fine wine, Harry Potter continues to improve with age as each succeeding film version of Rowling's books seemingly surpasses the last.",
33," July 14, 2007", Finally we're seeing Harry (the character and the series) grow up.,3.5/4
34," March 1, 2007"," The action in Goblet of Fire is more exciting and faster-paced than in previous Potter films, and visually, it is by far the most splendid.",
35," September 28, 2006"," This new story starts off as just another adventure, more or less, but by the end, the situation faced by its protagonists has become much darker, and much more dire.",3/4
36," September 28, 2006", Never feels anything other than a single thread of a larger narrative.,
37," September 10, 2006", click to read full review [Greek],4/5
38," August 26, 2006"," The grim tone feels overwrought but, in [Mike] Newell's hands, and in those of his cast and screenwriter's, the movie remains dramatically solid",3/4
39," June 24, 2006"," Newell handles this unfamiliar material competently enough, but the film never picks up any true momentum.",3/5
40," April 1, 2006"," It's refreshing that Potter 4 aspires to be a paranoid thriller rather than yet another detective mystery. House points, too, for the movie's terrific effects and considerable charm.",3/5
41," March 21, 2006"," The series is now being treated as it should be, with the right mix of magic, danger, and drama, without watering anything down just so a younger audience can be snagged.",5/5
42," March 18, 2006"," Anything but a disappointment. Even if it doesn't achieve the lyrical enchantment of Prisoner of Azkaban, it nonetheless makes good on Rowling's darker turn in the series.",3/5
43," February 21, 2006"," For me, the best entry in the series--the sweetest, the most exciting, the most moving, and the most touching.",9/10
44," February 9, 2006"," Goblet is deliciously dark, wickedly funny and superbly mounted.",
45," February 7, 2006"," In the book this is a wholly engrossing story -- an epic tale of good and evil and loss and yearning. Transported to the screen, however, it has sustained a few dinks and dents. ",2.5/4
46," January 17, 2006"," It's too episodic, relying on action rather than emotion. The pace is headlong, so that the characterisation suffers.",
47," January 9, 2006", The film's quick pace and near-constant action carries you along quite nicely.,4/5
48," December 29, 2005", So bloated and joyless that it makes one pine for the bland mediocrity of Chris Columbus.,C
49," December 27, 2005"," Even though Goblet of Fire clocks in at a robust 157 minutes, Newell handles the massive story with seeming ease, keeping the pace taut and intensifying the pervasive menace that lurked more subtly in the previous films.",4/4
50," December 12, 2005"," With the Triwizard Tournament as the centerpiece, director Mike Newell fashions an action film for children that may be without any reasonable challengers.",B+
51," December 9, 2005"," Closer kin to numbers one and two in the series, in both massive running time and playing like more of a book-on-film than the artistic peak achieved by Alfonso Cuarón in the third installment.",8/10
52," December 8, 2005"," Without ever losing sight of what makes a Potter film truly magical, [director Mike] Newell provides an aura of genuine dramatic gravity.",4.5/5
53," December 8, 2005", The most focused Potter movie yet... it's all about puberty and death.,Full ReviewRead More 
54," December 6, 2005"," Newell not only does Harry Potter right but eclipses the scope, scares and drama of his J.K. Rowling source novel.",
55," December 6, 2005"," It emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom.",3.5/5
56," December 6, 2005", Thankfully we have the increasingly interesting characters and their interactions to provide the bulk of the entertainment.,8/10
57," December 6, 2005"," Newell has always been a capable showman, and he doesn't cheat the Potter audience. Yet I don't think he wows it, either.",B-
58," December 6, 2005"," Whenever it hits its stride, it's a well-acted, vividly executed, full-speed-ahead special-effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene.",
59," December 6, 2005"," What does work, as in the last film, is how richly the filmmakers dive into Harry's growing and evolving adolescent personality.",3/4
60," December 6, 2005", An overlong film.,
61," December 6, 2005", Works as a piece of blockbuster entertainment.,3/5
62," December 6, 2005", The film's real pleasure is in the connections it makes (whether intentional or not) to current 'real world' questions about the beneficence of institutional authority.,
63," December 6, 2005"," Newell proves -- well, wizardly in depicting Hogwarts' inner workings.",B
64," December 6, 2005"," A focussed, efficient film that lacks charm but gets the job done.",4/5

66," December 6, 2005"," It feels a little rushed, and although it is still a picture worth seeing, it stands as one of the weaker chapters in the Potter series.",3/5
67," December 6, 2005"," Once again Grint, who has grown up to be a talented comic actor, is the scene stealer here. If I had a crystal ball, I'd say he's the actor whose post-Potter future seems most certain.",3.5/4
68," December 6, 2005", The human element is never overshadowed by the flashy stuff.,3.5/4
69," December 6, 2005", Enjoyable sequel that should please fans of both the books and the films %u2013 it looks as gorgeous as the last one did and this time they've even tightened up the plot a bit.,4/5
70," December 6, 2005"," Goblet has some truly stunning moments, especially the pitch black finale.",3.5/5

74," December 2, 2005", Wondrous to behold.,4/4
75," December 1, 2005"," Goblet of Fire is largely about the growing pains as the children inch towards adulthood, including love and all that comes with it, and Newell does a strong job of painting adolescent jealousy, crushes, and discomfort.",60/100
76," December 1, 2005"," The exhilarating Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes the best parts of J.K. Rowling's fourth installment and serves them up in one heck of an action-packed, albeit darker, film. Parents, be forewarned--this isn't kid's stuff anymore. ",4/4
77," November 29, 2005", An overstuffed plot doesn't slow down the proceedings as much as convey that there's much at stake in Harry's increasingly sinister world.,3/4
78," November 28, 2005"," For someone who has read the book, the film is very satisfying; glosses over important information for the uninitiated.",4/5
79," November 27, 2005"," Harry Potter ha crecido y para bien, lo que abre el apetito para la próxima cinta de la serie. Encantadora y mágica, es sin duda una de las más gratas sorpresas del año.",3.5/4
80," November 27, 2005"," The best part, I think, is that this fourth Harry Potter film goes further than its predecessors in setting out a moral map that reaffirms the values of human decency, loyalty and selflessness - and does so with great flair and endless entertainment.",
81," November 24, 2005"," Tenso e envolvente, embora substitua a complexidade psicológica e emocional do filme anterior por uma montagem mais preocupada com a história do que com os personagens.",4/5
82," November 24, 2005"," For once, Harry Potter is pushed to his limits. He doesn't just wave his flippin' wand and win the day.",B
83," November 23, 2005"," Has the curious distinction of being perhaps the best of the Harry Potter series, while not being quite the best film in its own right. ",4.5/5
84," November 23, 2005", My cup runneth over with tedium during this 2 1/2-hour supernatural slog.,2/4
85," November 23, 2005"," The billion-dollar franchise continues its reliable mix of youthful wonder, charm, and sense of adventure, all while making it accessible to adults and children alike.",9/10
86," November 23, 2005", Hits all the right spots but there's crucial context missing at times that leaves a vastly different impression with those who have followed the films but not read the books.,3.5/5
87," November 23, 2005"," Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed by the happenings at Hogwarts. Gone are the 'cute' little wizards and witches-to-be, but it's still magical.",4/5

111," November 19, 2005", This is really cool!,3.5/5

121," November 18, 2005"," Inventive visuals and funny bits abound, but the film's gritty look and unsentimental characterizations -- Harry, Hermione and Ron are far from golden teens -- ominously foreshadow the truly wicked shape of things to come.",3/4
