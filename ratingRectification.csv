2,2,2," December 8, 2014", Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.,8.0
3,3,3," December 8, 2014"," For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.",6.0

6,6,6," December 8, 2014"," The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.",7.0
7,7,7," December 8, 2014"," Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.",10.0

11,11,11," December 8, 2014"," By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.",9.0
12,12,12," December 8, 2014"," All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.",10.0
13,13,13," December 8, 2014"," Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.",7.0

81,81,81," November 27, 2005"," The best part, I think, is that this fourth Harry Potter film goes further than its predecessors in setting out a moral map that reaffirms the values of human decency, loyalty and selflessness - and does so with great flair and endless entertainment.",8.0
