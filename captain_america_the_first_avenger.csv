0," April 17, 2019", Chris Evans embodies the spirit of Captain America as the Marvel Cinematic Universe introduces us to the super soldier from Brooklyn.,5/5
1," February 8, 2019"," Captain America: The First Avenger is an agreeable diversion. It's rock 'em, sock 'em comic book fun, but unlike many of the onscreen locations, the story never really catches fire.",
2," January 18, 2019"," Overall, it's a pretty solid fare with a straightforward story.",
3," January 7, 2019"," The action is exciting, and even better, there's humor and heart.",3.5/5
4," December 8, 2018"," It may feel a little hokey, being set way back, but for me, it's an enjoyable easy watch with a sense of fun and escapism that it doesn't get full credit for.",8.5/10
5," November 4, 2018"," Nothing less than an action-packed good time with a great cast, a great lead, a great score and great action sequences. In case you haven't guessed by now, it's great.",7/10
6," November 1, 2018"," It's loaded with enough action and emotion to lure in audiences not steeped in comic book minutia, but also peppered with enough tie-ins and callbacks to send a tingle up the legs of the faithful. ",B+
7," August 29, 2018"," This movie improves on every viewing, especially with the hindsight subsequent MCU movies offer- but Peggy Carter deserves more!",
8," August 24, 2018", Captain America is simply awful. It is another hour and a half of prologue to the film people are apparently waiting for The Avengers.,1/5
9," July 17, 2018"," Parents of comic book fans could do much, much worse. ",
10," October 23, 2017", It's the big hit Marvel needed to be and a strong platform for The Avengers... ,
11," September 8, 2017", Captain America is a truly humble story that fortifies the character both physically and morally.,A-
12," August 21, 2017"," Director Joe Johnston tries to inject some pulpy '40s-style fizz into the proceeding, but the film's lead footed pace never seems to lighten up.",
13," November 29, 2016"," Though it's never much of a question who'll save the day, it's nice to be able to feel like the good guy's worth rooting for.",A-
14," July 22, 2016"," Captain America's a superhero due to a super serum, but he looks cool, has cool moves, and flings his shield with bombast, thus making America great again, and safe again.",4/5
15," July 14, 2015"," Director Joe Johnston re-confirms his mastery of special effects, but he doesn't let them get in the way of his telling a story.",3/4
16," July 14, 2015", It's simply an old-fashioned good-versus-evil yarn. And it's all the better for it.,
17," July 14, 2015"," Totally lacking in ambiguity, Captain America is great fun.",
18," July 14, 2015", Explosive and highly entertaining.,3.5/5
19," July 14, 2015"," This has definitely been the summer of the superhero film. I'd put this one just below X-Men: First Class, but above Green Lantern and well above Thor.",4/4
20," July 14, 2015"," It's very, very well done.",3.5/5
21," July 14, 2015"," Joe Johnston hits just the right tone, finding the heart of this often misunderstood character, and tempering proceedings with the perfect blend of humour, action and characterisation.",
22," July 14, 2015", It's no masterpiece but fun enough to continue to whet the appetite for The Avengers.,6/10
23," July 14, 2015"," As summer blockbusters go, it's a notch or two above average.",
24," July 14, 2015"," Though unfailingly earnest and cheesy from open to close, Captain America: The First Avenger still delivers everything it promises with plenty of endearing good humour and occasional pulses of exciting panache.",3/5
25," July 14, 2015"," As formulaic as it is, it's one of the more joyful examples of the genre, largely because it's a period piece.",
26," July 14, 2015"," As this summer's glut of superhero movies goes, let's just say that it's no X-Men: First Class but at least it's more enjoyably goofy than Thor.",
27," July 14, 2015"," The film's kitschy, retro production design is creative, some of the FX are endearingly hokey, and the screenplay has its share of laughs and solid dramatic moments.",3/4
28," July 14, 2015"," Full of exciting action and earnest emotion, Captain America: The First Avenger is perhaps the most superhero-ey of this summer's superhero movies.",3/4
29," July 14, 2015", The story squanders its own fine setup.,2/5
30," July 14, 2015"," Big and blousy, brash and loud and with a distinct twinkle in its star-spangled eye, it's the action movie to see if you really can't stomach any more wand-waving wizards and transforming robots.",9/10
31," July 14, 2015"," The best bit in this year's umpteenth comic book blockbuster, Captain America: The First Avenger, is when Tommy Lee Jones eats some steak.",1/5
32," July 14, 2015"," Chris Evans did the impossible. He became Steve Rogers, inside and out.",
33," July 14, 2015"," Viewed as the explosion-a-minute, simple action film that it's intended to be, Captain America delivers on what it needs to do: introduce the character to mainstream audiences while not offending longtime fans, and prime the public for The Avengers.",
34," April 9, 2014", ...a cut above its lackluster Marvel brethren for most of its running time (if only because it primarily resembles an actual movie more than it does a collection of special effects sequences).,3/4
35," March 20, 2014"," Captain America: The First Avenger feels like a clichéd blast from the past, lacking the spunk and grit that has made other comic book movies successful.",
36," June 30, 2013", A lifeless and clichéd action film that never lives up to its title or its title characters' ideals.,2.0/5
37," June 22, 2013"," It's difficult to dislike ""Captain America"" too much, because it's harmless and innocuous and, unlike almost every other tentpole summer movie, isn't secretly trying to give the audience a seizure. ",C+
38," April 12, 2013", The result is fun and refreshingly retro.,3/4
39," April 12, 2013"," A whizz-bang, retro-futuristic adventure that mercifully eschews the brooding Dark Knight trend to offer an exhilarating thrill ride that perfectly captures the enduring optimism of the 1940s.",3.5/4
40," March 2, 2013", Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely the best superhero film of the year and it's one hell of a fun ride. This is a must see!,9/10
41," December 28, 2012", The real marvel of it all is how much fun it actually is.,3/4
42," September 28, 2012"," Even next to Thor, a movie about a space god with a magic hammer, Captain America: The First Avenger was always going to be one of Marvel's trickiest properties to do justice to.",3/5
43," May 22, 2012"," ""With arguably the best supporting cast of the bunch, a cut-and-dried hero's hero who isn't portrayed as some cornball cheesy and a direct lead in to 'The Avengers,' this is my favorite of the Avengers set ups.""",9/10
44," April 8, 2012", As good a film version as can be made in this day and age by unapologetically embracing the square do-gooder nature of the character and concept.,3/4
45," January 29, 2012"," A slam-bang good time, Captain America: The First Avenger is one of Marvel's better efforts.",8/10
46," December 23, 2011"," What the film can never overcome, though it mightily tries via superior score, costumes, and atmosphere, is the inanity of its premise. ",2.5/4
47," November 22, 2011", One of the banner comic book films of the year.,
48," October 26, 2011"," As the delightfully over-the-top Red Skull, Hugo Weaving has the most fun playing a noseless villain since Ralph Fiennes lopped his off as Voldemort.",3/5
49," October 23, 2011"," Proves to be a riveting roller coaster ride from beginning to end, basically because it relies on a winning recipe featuring all the fixins needed to hold your undivided attention.",4/4
50," October 20, 2011", Combines the right elements of brisk storytelling and light touches of comedy without resorting to gimmicks or bombast. ,B+
51," October 19, 2011"," Because of its period atmosphere and its successful combination of characterization and action, it tops my list of best superhero films of the year.",7/10
52," September 29, 2011"," h omada toy Kapetanioy katafernei na swsei thn aksioprepeia ths, kyriws giati o skhnotheths petyxainei me tis camp eksarseis toy na xwsei ena kapoio epipedo aytosarkasmoy mesa sth sobarofaneia twn senariografwn",3/5
53," September 8, 2011", Director Joe Johnston confidently walks the line between faithful comic-book iconography and contemporary action-movie splash.,4/5
54," September 8, 2011"," Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to go to war. It's 1942, and he's a scrawny kid from Brooklyn, too scrawny, according to army doctors, to join up. ",
55," September 2, 2011"," It serves its chief end to introduce the character, and Evans fills the role nicely. But as a stand-alone adventure, it's not captivating enough. I expect more from this genre.",2.5/4
56," August 25, 2011"," ""Looks great and hits all the right notes but never truly puts the pedal to the metal.""",
57," August 21, 2011"," En una época en que aparecen películas de superhéroes debajo de cada piedra, encontrarse con algo tan entretenido - y que no pide ser tomado demasiado en serio - es toda una sorpresa.",3/5
58," August 19, 2011", The legend of the American hero is given a shot in the arm and pat on the back in the old school action/adventure Captain America: The First Avenger. ,3.5/5
59," August 12, 2011", This 'Star Spangled Man' has a plan: to be the best superhero movie of the year.,
60," August 11, 2011"," Flawless effects - including making a pre-captain Chris Evans look like a twig - plus top performances from the likes of Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones, ensure an old-fashioned quality to this appealing matinee-style adventure.",3/5
61," August 11, 2011"," It was the right choice to leave this film set in the 1940s during World War II. Not only was it good for this film, but it's a great setup for ""The Avengers.""",3/4
62," August 9, 2011"," A good, old-fashioned American story.",3.5/4
63," August 8, 2011", The best attempt thus far at bringing Cap off the page and onto screens. Too bad it was hamstrung by 'setupforsequelitis.',3.0/4.0
64," August 8, 2011"," In the era of the tortured superhero in movies, it's refreshing to come across one with enthusiasm and a pure spirit.",B-
65," August 4, 2011"," For the teenage fantasy crowd needing a new hero. But even if it feels like air conditioning in the Arctic, it's plenty entertaining.",4/5
66," August 3, 2011"," Rooted in reality and without the superhero tights, an impressive 3D success. The CGI transformation of Steve Rogers is fantastic. I worry that Stan Lee, through his Hickcock cameos, will appear in perpetuity in all Marvel movies.",
67," August 2, 2011"," After a decade of Dark Knights and doom and gloom predominating the spandex set, it's a relief to see a noble, essentially uncomplicated funny book character, even if the good captain is square as a brick. ",B+
68," August 2, 2011", It had more heart than 'Iron Man.',9/10
69," August 1, 2011"," No clever messages here, just bang-on romance and action, with another fresh twist on 20th-century history woven in for the kids to dive into after the credits have rolled.",8/10
70," August 1, 2011"," Even moviegoers suffering from superhero burnout might want to stand up and salute Captain America, which doesn't match the excellence of X-Men: First-Class but ranks ahead of fellow summer stablemates Thor and Green Lantern.",3/4
71," August 1, 2011"," Where are the iconic moments in these movies; the classic lines, the signature set pieces, the golden cues? Brand awareness is high but surely that wasn't the limit of the new studio's ambition?",
72," August 1, 2011"," It doesn't try too hard for irony or style; the comic-book sensibility remains pure, square, and happily stupid.",
73," July 31, 2011"," ... the best superhero comic-book movie since...well, ever.",5/5
74," July 31, 2011"," This one is okay, but I'm a little burnt out on the whole superhero thing. ",3/5
75," July 31, 2011", Captain America takes you back to the simplicity of a Saturday morning serial where you cheered the hero and booed the villain.,4/5
76," July 31, 2011", Altogether inferior to Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds.,
77," July 30, 2011", The final conflict is so protracted as to comfortably accommodate a bathroom break. Don't worry. You won't miss anything you haven't seen before.,2.5/5
78," July 29, 2011"," He's got the buff body, noble intentions and cool costume, but not much more. Captain America makes for a better propaganda symbol than superhero.",2.5/5
79," July 29, 2011", Capitão América é apenas uma promessa de filme - e caberá a Os Vingadores fazer jus a esta promessa.,3/5
80," July 29, 2011"," Joe Johnston delivers the squarest Marvel adaptation of the current cycle, and it's the film's pulp sense of adventure and the characters' old-fashioned decorum that make it so satisfying. ",3/4
81," July 29, 2011", Traditional Second World War thrillers meet the superhero era head on in Captain America - and the result is the first must-see blockbuster of the summer.,5/5
82," July 29, 2011"," about as good as we could expect it to be, if not more so given that its hero is certainly one of the blandest and least psychologically complex in the Marvel universe",2.5/4
83," July 29, 2011"," It's not as cool as Iron Man, doesn't have the brains of The Dark Knight or the looks of Thor, but it's got enough Ka-pow! to make you relish the inevitable sequel. Job done.",4/5
84," July 29, 2011", Evans is unprecedentedly touching and engaging for a superhero - and the rest of the cast help this adventure seem something close to character-driven instead of just being a bundle of stunts.,3/5
85," July 29, 2011"," These characters aren't just stick figures to fill in the time between the next set-piece; they talk, and argue, and appear to inhabit actual personalities.",3/5
86," July 29, 2011"," Far fleeter than most of its current comic-book-movie rivals, Captain America has some of the same rollicking Saturday-matinee spirit as Raiders of the Lost Ark, even if it can't match the earlier film's pace and panache.",
87," July 28, 2011"," If this is only The First Avenger, then bring on the rest of them.",4/5
88," July 28, 2011", Marvel are having a bumper year. After surprising us all with the hugely enjoyable Thor they've only gone and done it again.,4/5
89," July 28, 2011", The movie proves a solid if not superb opening salvo for the weakling-turned-super soldier.,
90," July 28, 2011"," No one is going to pretend that this is art, psychologically profound or anything other than preposterous. It is a popcorn movie, but much better than most of its kind.",4/5
91," July 28, 2011"," It ain't trailblazing, but it's solidly enjoyable.",3.5/5
92," July 28, 2011"," Political correctness, flamethrowers and Wagner!",
93," July 28, 2011"," Hugely enjoyable and superbly written, this is a thrilling action-adventure that gets everything right...",4/5
94," July 28, 2011"," Solid, efficient, often anachronistic: Captain America is earthbound when it needs to soar.",3/5
95," July 28, 2011"," Familiar, but great performances and pitch-perfect tone make this one of Marvel's best.",4/5
96," July 28, 2011"," The Captain isn't perfect, but he's the equal of Thor and loads better than the Green Lantern: he's the summer's pre-eminent superhero.",3/5
97," July 28, 2011"," Captain America, directed by veteran Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, October Sky, Hidalgo) delivers the goods in an engaging fashion.",3/4
98," July 28, 2011"," War movie clichés, gung ho derring-do and seamless special effects all fit together well in a pleasingly retro environment that boasts enough sci-fi paraphernalia to put an end to the argument that it may be too old-fashioned.",3/5
99," July 28, 2011"," While it's not the greatest superhero movie ever made, Captain America fittingly sets the stage for 2012's megamovie and - more importantly - nicely side-steps its potential pitfalls.",3/5
100," July 28, 2011"," Joe Johnston's adaptation of the Marvel comic book exalts the virtues of optimism, decency, and perseverance in a rousing adventure of old-fashioned adolescent exuberance.",3/4
101," July 28, 2011"," At least Captain America has a stab at being an independent, original creation before it falls back on the same old go-to's with their same old eye patches.",
102," July 27, 2011", Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers with the appropriate amount of earnestness and the art direction and costume design sell the 1940s as seen through a comic-book lens. ,2.5/4
103," July 27, 2011"," The effects work...integrates flawlessly with the rich, muted retro-themed colour palette of cinematographer Shelly Johnson, one of the few lensers able to work the darkening effect of the 3D process to the film's advantage.",
104," July 27, 2011"," As superhero flicks go, the first half of Captain America -- the one that counts -- is well above average. But the real superheroics here belong to the F/X team.",7/10
105," July 27, 2011"," It's for anyone who can respond to the thrill of a big, bold adventure movie with a sense of fun.",4/5
106," July 27, 2011"," The film does have its thrilling moments and iconic images, but, as directed by Joe Johnston, it's very much a storybook film.",3/5
107," July 27, 2011"," Captain America paints a simple tale of goodies versus baddies with none of the depth, humor or class of Marvel's earlier X-Men summer offering.",2/5
108," July 27, 2011"," Johnston should be saluted for old-fashioned heart in a cynical age, while Marvel should be confined to barracks for cynical marketing.",3/5
109," July 27, 2011"," Pure, unashamed, adrenaline-fuelled joy, with a revelatory lead turn that should nudge Chris Evans towards being a top-tier action hero.",4/5
110," July 27, 2011"," Pacy and punchy, but not quite a knockout.",3/5
111," July 26, 2011"," None of it, however, would work without Evans' easy charm. His appeal is different to his Marvel stable mates; he is modest, kind and, ahem, a virgin (this is certainly not the persona Evans has given off in other films).",4/5
112," July 26, 2011"," For starters, a comic book story set during World War Two offers a perfect opportunity to banish irony, make use of Nazis as bad guys, and cheer on an all-American hero. Chris Evans is well cast in the leading role, as he not only embodies the physical...",2.1/2
113," July 26, 2011"," The best superhero movie of the summer - good acting, good special effects, good storyline, and a heaping dollop of patriotism.",8/10
114," July 25, 2011"," It is a good superhero origin story, a bit better than the last such Marvel movie, 'Thor.'",B
115," July 25, 2011"," A gorgeous-looking movie, especially in 3D.",
116," July 25, 2011", Paramount and Marvel merged their creative juices just right as I found Captain America: The First Avenger very entertaining,4/5
117," July 25, 2011"," [E]normously entertaining... deft and witty... [C]heering and poignant at the same time, recalling the promise of a future that ended up going in a different direction...",
118," July 25, 2011", Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell end up stealing the show. That's not a good thing for Captain and Red Skull. ,6/10
119," July 25, 2011"," The production design is fantastic, the period setting works, and there's enough charm to allow the film to feel unique enough to justify its existence.",3.5/5
120," July 25, 2011"," [A] clean, unpretentious, brawnily entertaining fantasia.",4/5
121," July 25, 2011"," It's simple, but effective and engaging.",
122," July 25, 2011"," The super hero recipe is the Marvel gift that keeps giving and Captain America sticks to it with the best ingredients it can find by way of cast, to deliver a star spangled burger with the lot",
123," July 24, 2011"," A few flashes of greatness appearing throughout, all but ruined by one of the worst 3D transfers of the year",2/5
124," July 24, 2011", Taps into the idea that deep down we all want to dress up and play hero.,
125," July 24, 2011"," While not a terrible film, Captain America lacks edge necessary to excite viewers.",5/10
126," July 24, 2011"," Sadly, rather than hyping up The Avengers, it left me ruing the fact that we won't see more period Captain America films.",3/5
127," July 24, 2011"," Oh man, it is a great film. It is pretty much exactly what I wanted.",4/5
128," July 23, 2011", A fun and snappy introduction to one of the seminal heroes of the Marvel Universe and a nice last note before next year's Avengers film. Captain America is one of the more successful of the Marvel superhero movies.,3.5/5
129," July 23, 2011"," The movie is an engaging sensation I didn't want to see end, and when the Avengers do finally assemble summer 2012 here's hoping they're initial engagement is half as thrilling a spectacle as this one proved to be.",3.5/4
130," July 23, 2011"," ""A film that, while never straying too far from comic book movie formula, still manages to be satisfying as both origin story and standalone adventure.""",7.5/10
131," July 23, 2011", Hating on Captain America just isn't American. Go ahead and move to Canada; I'm sure they have some magical Mountie who's thwarting evil loggers.,3.5/4
132," July 23, 2011", Captain America's rousing first half proves Chris Evans was the right choice to play the Star Spangled hero.,3/4
133," July 23, 2011", Worst Superhero movie of the summer. Movie spends too much time showing a contempt for the character and is hampered by a script that gives too much away in the wrong places. ,C
134," July 23, 2011"," I liked the film. I like almost any film where someone warns the villain, ""You cannot control the power you hold! You will burn!""",B
135," July 23, 2011"," Director Johnston once again channels Steven Spielberg, this time for a raucously entertaining Indiana Jones-style adventure. With the energetic punch of a vintage serial, it actually leaves us wanting more.",4/5
136," July 23, 2011", The chief strength of this production has to be the superb casting choices for the key roles. Evans has a screen charisma that goes beyond his ruggedly handsome frame and piercing blue eyes. He displays a sense of humor and a warm gentle decency.,3.5/4
137," July 23, 2011"," This film succeeds where most comic book adaptations fail: a love story you actually feel, a mostly cohesive story and a believable superhero who manages to inspire all without being too far out of reach.",4.0/5.0
138," July 22, 2011"," In a year filled with superhero flicks, this one feels a little bit special.",4/5
139," July 22, 2011", It delivers the comic book action required.,B-
140," July 22, 2011"," ... a fast-moving, gee-whiz adventure that mixes plot elements from 'The Incredible Hulk"" and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with retro-futuristic art design that rivals 'Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow.'",3/4
141," July 22, 2011"," Slightly flawed, but ultimately worth seeing for its unique feel, period detail, and compelling central character. ",3/4
142," July 22, 2011"," Comic book fans are likely to appreciate Captain America, which does a good job of consolidating the disparate origin aspects of the character into something easily digestible.",2.5/4
143," July 22, 2011"," What makes ""Captain America"" interesting is that it is simultaneously a war movie and a superhero movie, executing all the trappings of both very well.",
144," July 22, 2011"," If you get bored during this film (I certainly did, despite all the eye candy on screen) you can amuse yourself by deciding which of the characters has the worst German accent. ",4/10
145," July 22, 2011", The light touch of self-parody serves the movie well.,63/100
146," July 22, 2011", The movie looks wonderful.,
147," July 22, 2011"," Kudos, then, to the creators of Captain America's big-screen blockbuster for keeping the action rooted in the past; except for some brief present-day bookends.",3/5
148," July 22, 2011", The only problem is that we've been there -- been nearly everywhere Captain America goes -- in countless previous movies.,
149," July 22, 2011"," When all these bland Marvel Comics franchise movies blur together in memory, it won't prove that they amounted to one great epic master narrative, but that they're all indistinguishable.",
150," July 22, 2011", Director Joe Johnston has fun with the myth of Captain America.,2.0/5
151," July 22, 2011"," The best superhero movie since the banner year of 2008, and the most purely enjoyable of them since that summer's effervescent Iron Man. ",8/10
152," July 22, 2011"," What lingers most about Captain America is its innocent, throwback ethos, a firm, unqualified embrace of the Little Guy.",
153," July 22, 2011"," A thrilling, exciting and enormously entertaining blockbuster that delivers plenty of exhilarating action, solid performances and the right amount of comic relief. ",8.32/10
154," July 22, 2011"," With its mix of World War II nostalgia, Bam-Pow comic book sensibilities, underdog determination and red-white-and-blue battle scenes, Captain America: The First Avenger is the best Marvel superhero flick since the first Iron Man.",B
155," July 22, 2011", Scrawny Steve is such a guileless and likeable little dude that his sweetness endures long past the super-sizing.,3/5
156," July 22, 2011"," Solid, stylish superhero saga that's more fun than 'Thor,' 'Green Hornet' and 'Green Lantern.'",8/10
157," July 22, 2011"," Comic book adventure mixes patriotism, explosive action.",3/5
158," July 22, 2011", Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely... whip up a Captain America story that often feels like its only purpose is to deliver Steve Rogers into the 21st century.,2/4
159," July 22, 2011"," What we don't have is a very compelling movie, or much of a leading man.",2.5/5
160," July 22, 2011"," Joe Johnston -- returning to the vibe of his first directorial effort, The Rocketeer (1991) -- creates a fun retro-futurist environment with a World War II setting, and he has the discernment not to let the effects overwhelm the story.",
161," July 22, 2011"," Despite all the advance hype preceding its release, Captain America, yet another 3-D Marvel Comics concoction, straggles onto the screen with little reason to exist except as a marketing machine.",
162," July 22, 2011"," I've always rather liked Captain America. Not due to any jingoistic BS, but because I'm a cynic, and Cap isn't.",3/5
